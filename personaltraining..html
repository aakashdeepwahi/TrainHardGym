<p class="h"><br>Personal Training</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p class="first">Personal fitness training is one on one health and fitness private training. Primarily it’s to motivate, educate and coach the client to achieving results and attaining their personal fitness goals. Each training session is designed specifically for the client and their fitness goals, which makes it so effective. With Personal Training there’s guidance and reassurance that you are performing the exercises with correct technique, without the risk of injury. From one training session to the next, you will be challenged at the right intensity for you with the appropriate training methods to keep you progressing in every session. Each training session lasts an hour and you will be guided from warm up, all the way through to stretching.
<br><br> Nutritional goals will be set on a weekly basis to keep you focused throughout your training. (As with the Personal Training, changes you make in your diet are also progressive lifestyle changes that will eventually become habitual and natural to you. No need for crash dieting or cutting out carbs as they do not work in the long run!)
No one wants to be disappointed, especially you.<br><br> Working with a personal trainer, you will be motivated to keep up the good work to avoid letting them down but more importantly yourself. I will support, inspire and get you through the tough times to keep you progressing in your personal fitness training. <br><br><a href="Subscription.html">Subscribe</a> to Join this amazing personal trainig session with our coach Mr. Micheal. </p>
